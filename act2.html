        <h1>wildlife conservation</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <p>Like forests, wildlife is also a national resource, which not only helps in maintaining the ecological 
          balance but is also beneficial from economic, recreational and aesthetic points of view. There was a time
           when human interference was minimum the number of wild animals was quite high and there was no problem of 
           their protection or conservation. But, with the expansion of agriculture, settlement, industrial and other developmental 
           activities and mainly due to greed of man, the number of wild animals gradually became lesser and lesser. With the
            result that several species of animals have become extinct and several, others are on the verge of being so.</p><br>
            <img src="image/wild1.jpg"><br>
        <p>Deforestation is also one of the main reasons for the loss of wildlife. Mass killings of wild animals for their meat, bones, 
          fur, teeth, hair, skin, etc., are going on throughout the world. Therefore, the need for wildlife conservation has now become a
           necessity.
           
          Population growth, expansion of agriculture and livestock raising building of cities and roads, and pollution are among 
          the many pressures on the natural habitat of wildlife. Along with illegal hunting, habitat reduction and its degradation
           has threatened the bio-diversity of the regions where these are rampant.</p><br>
           <img src="image/wild3.jpg"><br>
          
           <h5>Some steps in the direction of wildlife conservation could be as follows:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li> To survey and collect all the information about wildlife, especially, their number and growth.</li>

            <li>To protect habitat by protecting forests.</li>
              
            <li>To delimit the areas of their natural habitat.</li>
            <li> To protect wildlife from pollution and from natural hazards.</li>

            <li>To impose complete restriction on hunting and capturing of wildlife.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our organisation has worked for conservation of a number of wildlife species or habitat. Some of them are, 
            Salamander, Sea turtles, Lesser cats, Clouded Leopard, Goliath heron, marsh mongoose, etc. Endemic and endangered 
            species are our major focus. We strongly spread the message of saving wildlife and its habitat through our work 
            and various other communication strategies.</p>
