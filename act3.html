        <h1>Natural Resource Management</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <p>Natural resource management, or natural resources management, (NRM) is the management of natural resources such as land, 
        water, soil, plants and animals, with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present 
        and future generations.</p>
          <img src="image/natural4.jpg">
        <p>Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural landscapes interact. It brings together land
        use planning, water management, bio-diversity conservation, and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture, mining,
        tourism, fisheries and forestry. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our 
        landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.</p>

        <p>Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and ecology
        and the life-supporting capacity of those resources. Environmental management is similar to natural resource management.</p>

        <p>Our researchers always working for finding better solution for natural resources conservation.</p>
