        <h1>Ecology & Environment</h1>
      <div class="container">
        <p> Our organisation believes that one ecosystem is one planet. Humans as well as every other organism are dependent on their environment.
        Every living and non-living components of an ecosystem from plants to microbes to man is linked together in a complicated web. 
        Their interdependence results in their proliferation and even on their survival. Any change in their environment,
        even in distant parts of the planet affects living things and their environment elsewhere. Ecosystem along with its biotic 
        and abiotic components is an integral part of this environment.</p><br>
        <h2>Forest Ecology, Restoration & Conservation:</h2>
       <p1>Human history is based on clearance of forest. About 200 square kilometer of forest is being lost every day in the present world 
        (FAO 2006). Deforestation rates are highest in tropical developing countries which also includes India. Destruction of forest means damaging 
        the entire ecosystem and loss of all valuable natural resources, be it land, air, water or biodiversity. Ecological restoration 
        is “the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed” (Society for Ecological 
        Restoration Science and Policy Working Group, 2004). Protect Nature organised a team which work for forest conservation.</p1><br>

        <h2>Climate Change:</h2>
        <p1>Climate change is the biggest crisis in the history of mankind across the globe and India is a hard hit. Increasing temperatures, 
        erratic rainfall and changing seasons are leading to a number of dramatic and often dreadful consequences, like, loss of biodiversity,
        changing habitats, crop failure and food shortage, disease outbreak and other health stress, rising sea level and large scale 
        inundation, increasing disasters and a lot more. Poor are the most vulnerable as they lack access to necessary knowledge and 
        infrastructure to face the challenge. Mitigation options are minimal and we are beyond time. Adaptation is the only other way 
        to fight the situation.Protect nature work for both mitigating and adapting to climate change 
        starting from the advocacy to grassroots level.</p1><br>

        <h2>Water Conservation:</h2>
        <p1>Freshwater scarcity is one of the biggest crisis world is facing today. One third of world’s population is living with water crunch. 
        By 2025, 1800 million people across the globe will face acute water scarcity and India will be a water stressed country. 
        Human race does not have enough time to think or discuss about saving this priceless natural resource, rather it is the 
        time to act for conserving water everywhere each single way possible to keep alive themselves.</p1><br>

        <h2>Waste Management:</h2>
        <p1>Improper waste management practices and insufficient waste management system/infrastructures are becoming
        a severe obstruction to achieving clean water, air, uncontaminated soil or safe food. A number of health issues are
        also emerging from waste contaminations. Waste management not only addresses prevention of pollution but also concerns
        about getting wealth out of waste. Reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery and disposal are the five parts of waste management.</p1><br>
